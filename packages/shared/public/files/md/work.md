[All your base are belong to us](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/All_your_base_are_belong_to_us) is a popular Internet meme based on a badly translated phrase from the opening cutscene of the video game Zero Wing. The phrase first appeared on the European release of the 1991 Sega Mega Drive port of the 1989 Japanese arcade game.

By the early 2000s, a GIF animation depicting the opening text was widespread on the Something Awful message forums and other internet forums. The phrase found popular reference outside internet forums through the 2000s and 2010s, including use by Newgrounds in 2001

> **Benefits**: No massive local development environment, complicated architecture explanations. If the dev has the correct skills for that MicroFrontend, eg React & Redux, then they can get the job done quickly with no onboarding

Packages means modules or components. They can be frontend clients or backend microservices as long as they are JavaScript. Their dependencies are managed by [lerna](https://lerna.js.org/). Each package has it's own repo making it easy to separate work into teams.

eg: Let us say there is an [Issue](https://github.com/listingslab-software/menu/issues/1) on Github relating to the Menu Microfrontend. We can assign the issue to a developer who only needs to checkout the [menu repo](https://github.com/listingslab-software/menu), do her development locally and raise a pull request when done
